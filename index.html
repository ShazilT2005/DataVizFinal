        <h1>Where it Pays to Attend College</h1>
        <p>By Shazil Taqi</p>
        <p>This project explores the correlation between the type of college attended and the average salary of its graduates, aiming to debunk the myth that attending a more prestigious college necessarily leads to higher earnings. Through comprehensive data analysis and interactive visualizations, we reveal insights into the true impact of educational choices on financial outcomes.</p>
