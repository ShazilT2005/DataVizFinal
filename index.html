					<h4>This project delves into the relationship between the choice of college and the subsequent average salary earned by its graduates. The prevailing notion that attending a prestigious college guarantees higher earnings is challenged through thorough data analysis and interactive visualizations. By scrutinizing a wide range of data, we aim to uncover the genuine impact of educational decisions on financial trajectories.
            The analysis likely involves gathering data from various sources, such as alumni surveys, employment records, and public databases. Factors such as the type of college (e.g., Ivy League, state university, liberal arts college), field of study, geographic location, and socioeconomic background may be considered to provide a comprehensive understanding of the correlation between education and earnings.
            Interactive visualizations, such as charts, graphs, and maps, are utilized to present the findings in an engaging and accessible manner. These visualizations may allow users to explore different variables and filter data according to their interests, providing a nuanced perspective on the relationship between college choice and financial outcomes.
            Ultimately, the project aims to challenge preconceived notions about the importance of college prestige in determining earning potential. By shedding light on the true impact of educational choices, it seeks to empower individuals to make informed decisions about their educational paths, based on their personal goals and aspirations.<br />

							<h3>Visualization 2: Scatter Plot</h3>
							<p>This scatterplot offers a visual representation of the relationship between the starting and mid-career median salaries across different types of schools, such as Ivy League universities, state colleges, liberal arts institutions, and vocational schools. By plotting each school type's median salaries on the x and y axes, respectively, viewers can quickly discern the disparities and trends in financial outcomes among graduates. The distribution of data points on the scatterplot provides insights into whether attending a specific type of school correlates with higher salary growth over time or if there are notable variations in earnings trajectories. Additionally, the visualization may incorporate interactive elements, allowing users to hover over data points for specific details or filter the data based on additional factors such as location or field of study, further enhancing the depth of analysis and understanding.</p>
