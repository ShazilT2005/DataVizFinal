        <h1>Where it Pays to Attend College</h1>
        <p>By Shazil Taqi</p>
        <p>This project explores the correlation between the type of college attended and the average salary of its graduates, aiming to debunk the myth that attending a more prestigious college necessarily leads to higher earnings. Through comprehensive data analysis and interactive visualizations, we reveal insights into the true impact of educational choices on financial outcomes.</p>

            <h2>Visualization 3: Bar Chart: Distribution of starting salaries in different types of colleges</h2>
            <p>Summary:

The bar chart visualizes the distribution of starting salaries across different types of colleges. Each bar represents a specific type of college, and the height of the bar corresponds to the starting median salary for that type of college. The x-axis displays the types of colleges, while the y-axis represents the starting median salary.

Tooltip Functionality:

When you hover over a bar, a tooltip appears.
The tooltip displays information about the corresponding college, including the school name, starting median salary, and school type.
This information allows users to gain insights into individual data points within the chart, facilitating a deeper understanding of the distribution of starting salaries across different types of colleges.</p>
